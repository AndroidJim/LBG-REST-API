## Example Tests


### Unit

An example unit test we can create for this project is to test the product builder.
If we test the builder and input a name of "Lemon", a description of "A yellow citrus fruit", and a proce of 0.4. 
We can expect an object to be created that mathes this format

~~~ javascript
{
    name : "Lemon",
    description : "A yellow citrus fruit.",
    price : 0.4
}
~~~

### Integration

An example integration test we can create for this project is to test the RESTful endpoints.
If we test the DELETE endpoint by sending a request with a method of "DELETE" and a path of "/product/delete/1" 
We should expect the response to be:  

Status Code: 204 
Status tesxt: No Content 

### System Testing

Our first example of system testing is "system integration testing" to perform this on our project we could 
integration test the CREATE method and then check that the output from the READ method is expected.

If we created our lemon above (unit test) and recieved a status code 201 created we could then read all of the products
and expect a status code of 200, status text of Ok, and a message body containing the lemon that we created.

Alternatively, we could "black box" system test by using the front end to create a new product and reading the page to
confirm the new product has been created.

### User Acceptance Testing

An example of a User Acceceptance Test is that the product can be created from the UI as a user.

"As a" user
"When" I enter a product id into the update field
"and" enter new information
"I Want" to be able to see that the product has been updated

GIVEN that a user can access the front-end of the API
WHEN they enter a valid id into the update field
AND they enter a name
AND they enter a description
AND they enter a price
AND they click on the PUT button
THEN the updated product is visible on the page.
